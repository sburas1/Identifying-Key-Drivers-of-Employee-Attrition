📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is one of the biggest challenges organizations face. Understanding why employees leave can help businesses design better retention strategies, reduce recruitment costs, and improve workplace culture.

This project analyzes employee data to uncover the key drivers of attrition using data analytics and machine learning. By identifying the most influential factors, we aim to provide actionable insights that organizations can use to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze employee demographics, work-related factors, and performance indicators.

Identify patterns and correlations between features and attrition.

Build predictive models to determine which employees are most at risk of leaving.

Highlight the top drivers of attrition to support HR decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Excel for preprocessing and exploration

📊 Key Insights

Employees working overtime showed a higher attrition rate.

Certain roles (e.g., Laboratory Technicians) experienced higher turnover percentages compared to others.

Surprisingly, a significant portion of employees who reported a high work-life balance still left the company.

The top contributing drivers identified by the decision tree and regression models were:

Overtime

Total Working Years

Monthly Income

Department (R&D in particular)

🔍 Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values, duplicates, and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized demographic and job-related factors to detect attrition trends.

Modeling

Built and compared multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Feature Importance Analysis

Ranked features contributing most to attrition prediction.
